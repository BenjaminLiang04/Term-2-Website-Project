		<p><a href="https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/">Breath of the Wild</a> is a single-player action-adventure game that was made and developed by Nintendo. Breath of the Wild, or BOTW for short, follows the protagonist, Link, as he wakes from a 100-year slumber in an odd-looking shrine with no recollection of his past to an oddly familiar voice calling out to him. After exiting the odd-looking shrine link stumbles across an old man who sets him upon a quest to defeat the embodiment of malace known as Ganon. On his quest Link meets a wide array of interesting characters while on his quest to save this mysterious voice that seems almost nostalgic.</p>
