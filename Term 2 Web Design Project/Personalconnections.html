		<p>My curiosity for Breath of the wild started when I first saw the
		 trailer in 2017 and got interested. Later in the year when Breath 
		of the Wild was officially out in stores, my sister and I went and 
		bought it from the Nintendo store. Both of us had a lot of fun playing
		Breath of the Wild and I thought it would be nice if I could
		inform others about Breath of the Wild, therefore I chose Breath of the Wild as my topic.</p>
